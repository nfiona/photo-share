# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements
**2: Progressing**
> The app contains two models and implements user authentication. Nice job putting in Devise.

## Creativity and Interface
**3: Excelling**
> The design and color scheme here are very  nice. You clearly put a lot of thought into this. Also, excellent that this is responsive. Maybe use flexbox to make the header and footer sticky.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

## Deployment and Functionality
**3: Excelling**
> Application was successfully deployed.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**2: Progressing**
> Nice job using Trello to plan. I also love that you included future features you want to implement. I would, however, update your master branch to include the documentation you have in the devise branch. Also, you should include installation information on how to run the add locally.
